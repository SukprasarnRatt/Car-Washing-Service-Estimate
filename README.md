# Car Washing Service Estimate - C++ Practice

This is a basic C++ program created as part of a learning challenge in Section 6 of a C++ course.

## 🚗 PoPo's Car Washing Service

The program simulates a car washing service estimate generator. It:

- Prompts the user for the number of small and large cars.
- Calculates the total cost.
- Applies a 6% sales tax.
- Outputs a detailed estimate valid for 30 days.

## 💡 Sample Output

How many number of small cars would you like washed? 3

How many number of large cars would you like washed? 1

Cost: $110

Tax: $6.6

====================================

Total estimate: $116.6

This estimate is valid for 30 days

Thank you for using PoPo's Car Washing Service

Have a nice day!
